# Online Shoppers Purchase Intentions

The objective of this project is to analyze user Browse behavior to predict whether a user will complete a purchase during an online shopping session. We accomplished this by combining detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with a powerful machine learning model, XGBoost, to uncover insights and build an accurate predictive model.

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Loaded the dataset, which contained 18 behavioral features and a target variable (**`Revenue`**).
* Categorical features (**`Month`**, **`VisitorType`**, **`Weekend`**, etc.) were encoded into a numerical format.
* Numerical features were scaled using **`StandardScaler`** to ensure optimal model performance.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Sessions leading to a purchase had a significantly higher number of total pages viewed, particularly Product-Related pages.
* **Returning Visitors** were the most common visitor type and had a higher likelihood of making a purchase.
* The **`PageValues`** feature was a strong indicator of purchase intent, with higher values correlating with purchases.

### 3. XGBoost Model & Evaluation

* We trained an **XGBoost Classifier** to predict purchase intent. The model was optimized using **`GridSearchCV`**.
* The most influential features were **`PageValues`**, the month of **November**, **`BounceRates`**, and **`ExitRates`**.
* The final model demonstrated strong performance, achieving a high accuracy and a robust **ROC-AUC score**, indicating its excellent ability to distinguish between sessions that resulted in a purchase and those that did not.

### 4. Insights & Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize High-Value Pages:** 
The **`PageValues`** feature was the single most important predictor of a purchase. 
The business should focus on optimizing the content, design, and user experience of these specific pages to further encourage conversions.

2.  **Optimize for Returning Visitors:** 
**Returning Visitors** are the most likely to make a purchase. 
Personalized marketing efforts, targeted promotions, and a streamlined checkout process could significantly boost sales from this key customer segment.

3.  **Reduce Bounce and Exit Rates:** 
High bounce and exit rates are strong indicators of a lost sale. 
The company should investigate pages with high rates to understand why users are leaving. Potential solutions include improving navigation, page load speed, or simplifying the user interface.

4.  **Leverage Seasonal Trends:** 
The month of **November** was identified as a critical period. 
The company should strategically plan its promotions, advertising, and inventory to capitalize on the increased purchase intent during the holiday shopping season.
