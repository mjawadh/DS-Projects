Project Summary: Online Shoppers Purchase Intentions

The objective of this project is to analyze user Browse behavior to predict whether a user will complete a purchase during an online shopping session. We accomplished this by combining detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with a powerful machine learning model, XGBoost, to uncover insights and build an accurate predictive model.

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Loaded the dataset, which contained 18 behavioral features and a target variable (Revenue).

Categorical features (Month, VisitorType, Weekend, etc.) were encoded into a numerical format.

Numerical features were scaled using StandardScaler to ensure optimal model performance.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Sessions leading to a purchase had a significantly higher number of total pages viewed, particularly Product-Related pages.

Returning Visitors were the most common visitor type and had a higher likelihood of making a purchase.

The PageValues feature was a strong indicator of purchase intent, with higher values correlating with purchases.

3. XGBoost Model & Evaluation
Trained an XGBoost Classifier to predict purchase intent. The model was optimized using GridSearchCV.

The most influential features were PageValues, the month of November, BounceRates, and ExitRates.

The final model demonstrated strong performance, achieving a high accuracy and a robust ROC-AUC score, indicating its excellent ability to distinguish between sessions that resulted in a purchase and those that did not
